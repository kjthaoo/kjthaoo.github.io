        <h1>My Game Development Experience With Unity</h1>

        <p>In the fall semester of 2023, I developed my very first video game using Unity for a 'Environmental and Transposition' project in my Media Arts course, MART380. My game titled, <b>'In The Present'</b>, immerses players in the shoes of an overworked student on a journey to discover the true meaning of life. The purpose of creating this game was to develop an environment that oneself have experience themselves, whether that be imaginations or in real life, this allows us to share that experience with others. When considering the mood and emotions I wanted to convey in my game, I focused on adjusting the lighting, audio, and weather elements. In which Unity did a great job at providing a user-friendly platform for beginners like me to use. </p>
        <p>Below I will expand more on my experiences with using Unity. This will include the challenges I've encountered, the pros and cons of Unity, and two links at the end. Eventually, there will be more information on the decisions behind my game design. Here are two screenshots of a top view and inside view of my game environment.</p>
