        <h1>Why Chickens Are Top Tier Pets</h1>
        <p>
            Chickens are one of the best pets to own. The reason for that is because chickens are companionable and easy to care for! They are low maintence and benefit your garden. 
            By doing so, they help control the pest by eating backyard bugs and their manure can be used as compost.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are a ton of benefits to having a pet chicken. Those include having fresh eggs from the hens, being a source of stress relief, fun to watch and socialize with, and great with kids!
            Chickens are known for their large appetites and will eat your leftover kitchen scraps like watermelon rind, rice, and chopped vegetables and fruits. Chickens are also great at guarding, especially
            the roosters. They provide an alert system for the flock, even letting you know there's a something dangerous looming over the farm, like a hawk. Another fun fact is that, Chickens come in all kinds
            of shapes and sizes. There are currently over 500 recognized chicken breeds worldwide.
